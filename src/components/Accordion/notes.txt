Data Fetch Logic:
    Defines an initial state object with data, isLoading, and
  error properties.
    Defines an async thunk function fetchPosts that fetches
  data from an API using Axiosthen sliced to include only the
  first three elements.
    Creating a slice using createSlice with a configuration
  object that includes the slice name, initial state, and
  empty reducers object, and defining extraReducers to handle
  the pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions that occur when
  the fetchPosts function is called.

Logic: Accordion
  The child div, which is the panel, is hidden only when the
expanded variable does not match the index of the current
post. When the user clicks on the button, it calls the 
handleToggle function, which updates the expanded state to
match the index of the clicked item. This causes the 
corresponding child div to become visible, while all other
child divs become hidden.

Logic: Keyboard Event Custom Hook
    Defines a custom React hook called useKeyboardEvents that
  takes an object of posts as input. It returns an object
  containing two properties: activeIndex and handleKeyDown.
  The activeIndex property is initialized to null using the
  useState hook and represents the index of the currently
  active post. The handleKeyDown function is called when a key
  is pressed on the keyboard and updates activeIndex based on
  the key that was pressed. The arrow keys update the index to
  the next or previous post, while the tab key cycles through
  the posts in order.
